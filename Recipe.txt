Struggling to get your Wellington to retain its shape? Use lots of cling film to help keep your layers tight. Start by rolling out a couple of sheets of cling film across your counter (don't just use one in case it splits open). Then, using the back of a spoon, evenly spread your mushroom duxelle mix over, before placing your fillet on top.

Lift the edge of the cling film and wrap, as tight as possible (ensuring the fillet is covered), rolling the wrap into a perfectly formed cylinder. You can use this method again for your final later, this time wrapping your duxelle and beef within the puff pastry - remember the tighter your cling film wrap, the more perfect your shape will be.
